Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m) pattern past to the position 7 and eventually in above example we have got a perfect match of pattern (displayed in Green). We are doing this because does not exist in the pattern so at every shift before position 7 we will get mismatch and our search will be fruitless.

Here we have a mismatch at we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m) position 7. The mismatching character does not exist in pattern before position 7 so well shift pattern past to the position 7 and eventually in above example we have got a perfect match of pattern (displayed in Green). We are doing this because does not exist in the pattern so at every shift before position 7 we will get mismatch and our search will be fruitless.

In the following implementation, we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m)                      time in the best case.

Number of states in FA will be M+1 where M is length of the pattern. The main thing to construct FA is to get the next state from the current state for every possible character. Given a character x and a state k, we can get the next state by considering the string pat[0..k-1]x which is basically concatenation of pattern characters pat[0], pat[1] … pat[k-1] and the character x. The idea is to get length of the longest prefix of the given pattern such that the prefix is also suffix of pat[0..k-1]x. The value of length gives us the next state. For example, let us see how to get the next state from current state 5 and character C in the above diagram. We need to consider the string, pat[0..4]C which is ACACAC. The length of the longest prefix of the pattern such that the prefix is suffix of ACACACis 4 (ACAC). So the next state (from state 5) is 4 for character .

In the following code, computeTF() constructs the FA. The time complexity of the computeTF() is O(m^3*NO_OF_CHARS) where m is length of the pattern and NO_OF_CHARS is size of alphabet (total number of possible characters in pattern and text). The implementation tries all possible prefixes starting from the longest possible that can be a suffix of pat[0..k-1]x. There are better implementations to construct FA in O(m*NO_OF_CHARS) (Hint: we can use something like lps array construction in KMP algorithm). We have covered the better implementation in our next post on pattern searching.of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m) pattern past to the position 7 and eventually in above example we have got a perfect match of pattern (displayed in Green). We are doing this because does not exist in the pattern so at every shift before position 7 we will get mismatch and our search will be fruitless.

Here we have a mismatch at we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m) position 7. The mismatching character does not exist in pattern before position 7 so well shift pattern past to the position 7 and eventually in above example we have got a perfect match of pattern (displayed in Green). We are doing this because does not exist in the pattern so at every shift before position 7 we will get mismatch and our search will be fruitless.

In the following implementation, we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m)                      time in the best case.

The idea of bad character heuristic is simple. The character of the text which doesnt match with the current character of the we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m)pattern is called the Bad Character. Upon mismatch, we shift the pattern until

Here we have a mismatch at position 7. The mismatching character does not exist in pattern before position 7 so well shift we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m) pattern past to the position 7 and eventually in above example we have got a perfect match of pattern (displayed in Green). We are doing this because does not exist in the pattern so at every shift before position 7 we will get mismatch and our search will be fruitless.

In the following implementation, we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m)                      time in the best case.

We’ll lookup the position of last occurrence of mismatching character in pattern and if character does not exist we will shift pattern past the mismatching character. 

The mismatch becomes a match.
Pattern P moves past the mismatched character.
Case 1  Mismatch become match 
We will lookup the position of the last occurrence of the mismatched character in the pattern, and if the mismatched character exists in the pattern, then we’ll shift the pattern such that it becomes aligned to the mismatched character in the text T. 

Number of states in FA will be M+1 where M is length of the pattern. The main thing to construct FA is to get the next state from the current state for every possible character. Given a character x and a state k, we can get the next state by considering the string pat[0..k-1]x which is basically concatenation of pattern characters pat[0], pat[1] … pat[k-1] and the character x. The idea is to get length of the longest prefix of the given pattern such that the prefix is also suffix of pat[0..k-1]x. The value of length gives us the next state. For example, let us see how to get the next state from current state 5 and character C in the above diagram. We need to consider the string, pat[0..4]C which is ACACAC. The length of the longest prefix of the pattern such that the prefix is suffix of ACACACis 4 (ACAC). So the next state (from state 5) is 4 for character . 
In the following code, computeTF() constructs the FA. The time complexity of the computeTF() is O(m^3*NO_OF_CHARS) where m is length of the pattern and NO_OF_CHARS is size of alphabet (total number of possible characters in pattern and text). The implementation tries all possible prefixes starting from the longest possible that can be a suffix of pat[0..k-1]x. There are better implementations to construct FA in O(m*NO_OF_CHARS) (Hint: we can use something like lps array construction in KMP algorithm). We have covered the better implementation in our next post on pattern searching.of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m) pattern past to the position 7 and eventually in above example we have got a perfect match of pattern (displayed in Green). We are doing this because does not exist in the pattern so at every shift before position 7 we will get mismatch and our search will be fruitless.
Bad Character Heuristic
The idea of bad character heuristic is simple. The character of the text which doesnt match with the current character of the pattern is called the Bad Character. Upon mismatch, we shift the pattern until  

Here we have a mismatch at we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m) position 7.

The implementation tries all possible prefixes starting from the longest possible that can be a suffix of pat[0..k-1]x. There are better implementations to O(m*NO_OF_CHARS) array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m)pattern is called the Bad Character. Upon mismatch, we shift the pattern until  

Here we have a mismatch at position 7. The mismatching character does not exist in pattern before position 7 so well shift we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size.

The idea of bad character heuristic is simple. The character of the text which doesnt match with the current character of the we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size.

If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m) pattern past to the position 7 and eventually in above example we have got a perfect match of pattern (displayed in Green). We are doing this because does not exist in the pattern so at every shift before position 7 we will get mismatch and our search will be fruitless.

In the following implementation, we preprocess the pattern and store the last occurrence of every possible character in an array of size equal to alphabet size. If the character is not present at all, then it may result in a shift by m (length of pattern). Therefore, the bad character heuristic takes O(n/m)                      time in the best case. 
Case 2  Pattern move past the mismatch character 
We’ll lookup the position of last occurrence of mismatching character in pattern and if character does not exist we will shift pattern past the mismatching character. 

The mismatch becomes a match.
Pattern P moves past the mismatched character.
Case 1  Mismatch become match 
We will lookup the position of the last occurrence of the mismatched character in the pattern, and if the mismatched character exists in the pattern, then we’ll shift the pattern such that it becomes aligned to the mismatched character in the text T. 

Number of states in FA will be M+1 where M is length of the pattern. The main thing to construct FA is to get the next state from the current state for every possible character. Given a character x and a state k, we can get the next state by considering the string pat[0..k-1]x which is basically concatenation of pattern characters pat[0], pat[1] … pat[k-1] and the character x. The idea is to get length of the longest prefix of the given pattern such that the prefix is also suffix of pat[0..k-1]x. The value of length gives us the next state. For example, let us see how to get the next state from current state 5 and character C in the above diagram. We need to consider the string, pat[0..4]C which is ACACAC. The length of the longest prefix of the pattern such that the prefix is suffix of ACACACis 4 (ACAC). So the next state (from state 5) is 4 for character .
